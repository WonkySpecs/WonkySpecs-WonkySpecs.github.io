title: A year of drawing
---

Almost exactly a year ago, I started learning to draw. I'd been trying to learn to paint for a few months, and whilst I was having a lot of fun I was starting to feel pretty held back by my lack of drawing fundamentals. Drawing was something I'd been (theoretically) interested in for a while but, with no real aptitude or prior experience, wasn't something I'd _really_ considered doing properly.

A few motivational youtube videos later, I made a surprisingly firm commitment to giving it a good try. I wasn't going to dive in like mad for a week, then give up (my usual, bad, approach), but would take it slow and steady. Since then, I haven't drawn every day, but it's been more often than not, and I've filled a few sketchbooks in the process.

The big take aways for me are that

- I enjoy the process of drawing
- It's really hard most of the time
- It _is_ possible to learn and improve at it

It's a pretty wonderful hobby - I get away from screens, create something tangible, have had a lot of fun, and have made real, visible progress over the year. There's always going to be more to learn and improve at, but I don't feel too bad about the parts (still most of them) which I'm bad at, because I'm happy enough to be able to do it at all.

These are some of my favourites from the year. Not included - hundreds of ugly pictures and pages full of lines, shading, boxes. It's a grind at times, but it certainly feels worth it.

It's been a big old mix of things, from photos, from life, and from imagination, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I'd probably make more progress focussing hard on something specific, like figures or landscapes or animals, but I don't think I'd have as much fun and in the long term that's probably a better way to keep at it. Here's to many more years of scribblings.
