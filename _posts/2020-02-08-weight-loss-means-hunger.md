title: A simple thing to remember for losing weight
---
When we get hungry, a little, prehistoric, part of our brains becomes completely convinced that we are about to die, which tends to send it into a bit of a panic. This was a vital instinct to get us out and about when obtaining food meant grabbing a spear and heading into the wilds to hunt, but now that it instead means a ten minute trip to the supermarket that instinct has become not only obsolete, but also often detrimental to the many of us more concerned with keeping our weight down than gaining it.

This may be obvious to many, but I've found great success with consciously reminding myself that hunger = weight loss = good, silencing that inner monkey brain whenever possible. It always sucks at the time, but it's also always better later. For anyone struggling with maintaining a diet, maybe try giving it a shot, and best of luck with whatever you're trying to achieve.
