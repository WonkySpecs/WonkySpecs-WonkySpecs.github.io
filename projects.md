Currently working on a little puzzle game, [plannertron](https://github.com/WonkySpecs/plannertron), and an accompanying [library](https://github.com/WonkySpecs/ddnimlib) for 2D game dev in nim.

Some of the projects I've worked on which are reasonably complete:

- [Unruly Reviews](https://github.com/WonkySpecs/unruly-reviews), a site for quick board game reviews.
- [Arboretum](https://github.com/WonkySpecs/arboretum) server and web client. Pretty hacked together, not well tested, and still WIP, but a functional way to play arboretum over the internet.
- [Mandelbrot](https://github.com/wonkyspecs/mandelbrot/) rendering with Canvas.

Check out my github for other work in various stages of completion and abandonment.
